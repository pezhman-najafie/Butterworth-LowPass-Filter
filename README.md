# Butterworth-LowPass-Filter
 This repository implements a Butterworth low-pass filter for image processing using Python and OpenCV. It applies the filter to the Lena image with varying cutoff frequencies (D0) and filter orders (n), visualizing the results for different parameter combinations. Ideal for studying frequency domain filtering techniques.
